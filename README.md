## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Ramtin](https://www.ramtintjb.com)

Welcome to my page! 

I'm currently a third year CS @ UCSD and a former Software Engineer Intern at [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com). My goal is to learn every dark corner of C++, without losing my sanity.

ðŸ“š Currently reading:
- [Effective Modern C++](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Modern-Specific-Ways-Improve/dp/1491903996)
- [C++ High Performance](https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Master-optimizing-functioning/dp/1839216549)
- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321)
